I was made aware recently through a group exercise that some of my good qualities are “professional and reliable”. Although there’s nothing wrong with that (and I’m self aware how “angkat bakul” that previous statement was), it rubbed me the wrong way. “Is that how people see me?” I thought to myself. Kindness, if anything, I want to be remembered as kind, first and foremost. That’s what I learned from my father, and late grand father.

Not long after the introspection, I wrote a quote   from Dr. Wayne W. Dyer on a whiteboard during a meeting which reads, “If you have the choice between being right and being kind, choose being kind”. A voice from the room follows, “why though?”. As I sat down, I couldn’t answer. Although a million reasons flashed across my mind, I felt the quote answered itself.
