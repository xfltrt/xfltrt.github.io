title: Hello World, GitHub Pages, and a Fresh Start
---
I’ve got a new home for my thoughts. I made it simple to maintain and even simpler to read.

After moving between platforms, I decided on Jekyll and GitHub Pages. No servers, configurations, plugins and paywall. I designed the website to reflect this minimalistic approach. Inspired by Medium and taking it a step further, I’ve removed all the frills so my readers can focus on pure contents.

Not only a new home, this is a fresh start. I romanticised my history. Making sense of my past and retelling them in an idealistic light, when in truth, life isn’t always that blatant. My stories had forged an identity. An identity my everyday-self struggle to match. So I removed them to make way for new stories, new growth.
