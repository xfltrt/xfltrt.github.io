## Hello, I'm Fitri Ali.
Thanks for having an interest in my blog and myself. I write about things I learn in life, my hobbies, and my profession. I like security, programming, linux, design, powerlifting, and travel. I also enjoy casual gaming, reading, and other things which involves being alone.
